# AdventureGame

This is a very basic game styled after old text-based adventures.

Using JavaScript and the HTML canvas feature, the game builds a simple map to show the Player where they are and what obstacles they face.

The player can also 'sense' the presence of treasure and traps, so this feedback guides the player in their journey through the game.

Currently-supported commands: 
n(orth),s(outh),e(ast),w(est) and q(uit)
i,j,k,m: the same as north,south,east and west
