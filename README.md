HTML 200 week 4 assignment :: Simple Adventure Game

It adds a simple graphical mapping display to show the Player where they are and 
what obstacles they face.

The player can also 'sense' the preseence of treasure and traps, so this feedback guides the player in their journey through the game.

Currently-supported commands: 
n(orth),s(outh),e(ast),w(est) and q(uit)
i,j,k,m: the same as north,south,east and west
